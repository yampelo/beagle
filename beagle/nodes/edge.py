class Edge(object):
    """The base Edge class.

    An edge simply stores metadata about interaction between two nodes. Each
    Edge object is simply meant to store the metadata **on that Edge**. For example,
    for a file write event, it may want to store the time of the write, and the contents
    written.

    Since a write by Process A to File B may occur multiple times, all the properties
    stored on the edge must be arrays. When generating the graph, Beagle will either unpack
    all N properties into N edges or create a single edge with all the metadata. This will
    depend on the configuration for that run.


    Examples
    --------

    The below shows an Edge which represents a process launch. The edge contains
    a list of timestamps at which the parent process launched the child process::

        class Launched(Edge):
            __name__ = "Launched"

            timestamp: int

            def __init__(self) -> None:
                super().__init__()

    The edge would be used in the Process class as follows::

        class Process(Node):
            ...
            # List of launched processes
            launched: DefaultDict["Process", Launched]

    This would allow a process `parent` to add that it launched `child` at time 145:

    >>> proc.launched[child].append(timestamp=145)

    You can also add edges without explicitly adding data:

    >>> proc.launched[child]
